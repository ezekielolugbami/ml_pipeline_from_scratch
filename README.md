# ML Pipeline From Scratch
> This is an all level friendly repo showing how machine learning pipeline can be built from scratch adopting either the procedural programming approach or custom pipeline code or third-party code leveraging on the sckit-learn library. All three pipelines are built with the Titanic data set from Kaggle in mind https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

It is meant to show you how codes from the research environment 'Jupyter Notebook' are gradually been transformed into reusable pipelines while ensuring reproducibility and modularity in mind. I have also organised the code in a way that is easy for you to edit if you want to make changes to any of the file.


## Installation
