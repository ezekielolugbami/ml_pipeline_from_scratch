## ML Pipeline From Scratch

This is an all level friendly repo showing how machine learning pipeline can be built from scratch adopting either the procedural programming approach or custom pipeline code or third-party code. All three pipelines are built with the Titanic data set from Kaggle in mind https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

It is meant to show you how codes from the research environment 'Jupyter Notebook' are gradually been transformed into reusable pipelines while ensuring reproducibility and modularity in mind. I have also organised the code in a way that is easy for you to edit if you want to make changes to any of the file.

If you have any questions or suggestions for how I can make this better, tweet me at @olugbamiezekiel.
